## Objects and Classes in Objective-C

1. Create classes for an event manager app:
    * Each event has title, category, description, date and list of guests (strings)
    * Event manager can:
        * Create event
        * List all events
        * List events by category
        * Sort events by either date or title
* Create an iPhone application using the event manager. Create two views:
    * One for listing events
    * One for creating events
    * Use the class from the previous exercise
    * Research about creating iPhone apps
    * Research about segues and transitions between different views
