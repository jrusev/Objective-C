Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism

1. Implement classes for a simple Mortal Kombat game
    * Create characters that have name, set of skills, life and power
    * Different characters have different skills
    * Characters can punch, kick or use a skill
    * They cannot use a skill, if the power is not enough
    * Kicks and punches take damage and product power
    * Skills take damage and consume part of the power of the character
    * Create 5 different characters with different skills
    * Use protocols and inheritance
    * Write a method to test the functionality
    * Use abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism
