## Views and Controls in iOS

1. Create a table view cell containing an image and a title:
    * Use it inside a UITableViewController
* Create a custom view for representing tabs:
    * Each tab has a title and content
        * The content is visible only if the tab is selected
    * Only a single tab can be selected at a time
    * The content can contain any number of UIViews
